    "title": "Attribution of the Australian Bushfire Risk to Anthropogenic Climate Change",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article, based on the climate attribution study of the Black Summer bushfires in southeastern Australia (Oldenborgh et al. 2021), seeks to answer, in more accessible terms, the following question: Does and how does anthropogenic warming make extreme fire weather more common?\n\n\n\nWhat question are we really answering?\nThe 2019/20 “Black Summer” fires were intense and widespread. We need to answer two key questions for the public:\n\nHas “extreme fire weather” like that of 2019/20 become more common due to anthropogenic climate change?\nIf so, which specific meteorological factors are primarily “fueling” this trend?\n\nThe study focuses on southeastern Australia (between the Great Dividing Range and the coast), with the analysis window set during the local fire season (September to February annually).\n\n\nWhere does the data come from? How to “quantify fire risk”?\n1) Data source\nTo ensure the reliability of the analysis, key meteorological observation data from authoritative sources were used, as well as an ensemble of 11 large-scale advanced climate models (Such as CanESM2, EC-Earth, IPSL-CM6A-LR, weather@home, etc.). Detailed data source information is shown in Table 1:\n\n\n\nTable 1: Data sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData type\nData Sources\nTime range\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nAustralian Water Availability Project (AWAP) analysis\n1910–present\n\n\nTemperature\nNOAA Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 3 (20CRv3)\n1900-present\n\n\nTemperature\nJapanese Reanalysis (JRA-55)\n1958-2019\n\n\nTemperature\nFifth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5)\n1900-January 2020\n\n\nTemperature\nGISTEMP surface temperature\n1900-present\n\n\nDrought\nGlobal Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) v18\n1900-January 2020\n\n\nDrought\nCRU TS 4.03\n1901–2017\n\n\nDrought\nAWAP\n1900–January 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Key variables\nThe Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) (Dowdy et al. 2009) and the monthly severity rating (MSR) (Shabbar, Skinner, and Flannigan 2011) are the core focus of this analysis. Therefore, all variables used in the analysis are directly or indirectly related to these two indices. Specific variable information can be found in Table 2 below:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Information of key variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nMeaning\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nTX7x\nMaximum daily temperature value of the 7-day moving average within the year (July–June); more closely represents persistent heat waves\nAnalyzes the direct contribution of extreme heat to fire risk; calculated for both observations and models\n\n\nFWI7x-SM\nMaximum value of the 7-day moving average of FWI within the fire season, representing intensity\nOne of the main indicators of fire weather; significantly correlated with burned area\n\n\nMSR-SM\nMaximum value of the monthly severity within the fire season, representing persistence\nMeasures the likelihood of persistent burns\n\n\nP_low (Year/Dryest Month)\nQuantification of the extreme low end of annual precipitation or the driest month of the fire season\nExamines the long-term trend and attribution of meteorological drought\n\n\nDriving Components (T, RH, Wind, Precip)\nCalculates FWI Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation factors used\nIdentifying “who drives fire risk” in sensitivity analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Data cleaning steps\n\nData Screening: Each dataset was examined for its ability to reproduce the 1939 extreme heat event and the long-term warming signal; poorly performing datasets (Berkeley Earth, ERA-20C, CERA-20C) were excluded to prevent systematic biases from misleading extreme value fitting.\nUnified Time Window: The retained data were uniformly processed, truncated according to the Southern Hemisphere fire season (February–September). The statistical window for TX7x was defined as June–July of each year to ensure coverage of the entire fire season and capture heat waves spanning the entire year.\nIndicator Construction:\n\nCalculate ​FWI/DSR​ based on daily T, RH, Wind, and Precip, then construct ​FWI7x-SM​ and ​MSR-SM;\nConstruct ​TX7x​ from the daily maximum temperature series;\nCompute the ​annual precipitation extreme low value​ and ​driest month​ indicators for drought analysis.\n\nPre-Analysis Quality Control:\n\nFitting and stability checking of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) for various extreme values;\nEvaluating model parameters (scale σ, shape ξ), removing or downweighting members with excessively large extreme value variances or small trends to avoid underestimating attribution strength.\n\n\n\nSummary: The above cleaning steps are intended to minimize systematic biases in the data and model, ensuring robust estimates of “extremes and trends”, especially the extreme value fitting and attribution of TX7x and FWI/MSR.\n\n\n\nHow to analyse? Let’s see what the figures and tables “say”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Correlation between the logarithm of area burned (10 log(km2) and the 7 d maximum FWI for each month of the year\n\n\n\nKey Points for Reading the Graph: The larger the horizontal axis, the higher the fire weather index (FWI) for that month; the larger the vertical axis, the greater the area burned that month. The regression line shows a significant upward trend, meaning the higher fire risk, the greater likelihood of larger burned areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sensitivity analysis of the FWI7x-SM to changes in individual contributions from relative humidity (RH, wind, temperature and precipitation)\n\n\n\nKey Points for Reading the Graph: Rising temperature was identified as the primary driver of the FWI increase, contributing approximately 50%, while changes in precipitation and relative humidity also played a significant role.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Changes in key indicators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator (Event Definition)\nReal World (ERA5)\nModel Composite\nDominant Driver\n\n\n\n\nFWI7x-SM (Intensity)\n≥4 times more likely (PR lower bound)\n≥+30% more likely (lower bound, model is conservative)\nTemperature increase is the primary contributor; Relative humidity decrease is second\n\n\nMSR-SM (Persistence)\n≥9 times more likely (PR lower bound)\nApproximately double (but not statistically significant)\nSimilar to above\n\n\nTX7x (Extreme Heat)\nPR ≈ 10 times more likely\n≥ 2 times more likely\nTemperature rise is the primary factor\n\n\nDrought (year/driest month)\nNo clear attributable trend\nSame as above\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will refer to these figures and tables several times later to connect the complete story line.\n\n\nResults and Interpretation\n1) Anthropogenic warming makes “extreme fire weather” more common\n\nIntensity: Compared to 1900, the probability of the FWI7x-SM index reaching the 2019/20 peak value has increased by at least 4 times; although the model synthesis is conservative, it still indicates an increase of at least 30% (see Table 3).\nSustainability: For MSR-SM, the probability increased by at least 9 times; the model average showed an increase but did not reach significance (the confidence interval included “no change”).\n\n\nWhy are the results from ERA5 reanalysis and climate models so different? Most models overestimate interannual fluctuations and underestimate the impact of long-term warming on extremes, making the model-based “probability increase” often conservative.\n\n2) Who is “adding fuel to the fire”? — Mainly hotter extreme temperatures\nSensitivity analysis for 2019/20 shows that temperature rise contributed the most, followed by a decrease in relative humidity; the effects of wind and precipitation varied by model. This is consistent with intuition: hot, dry, and windy days are more likely to cause fires to burn out of control (see Figure 2 and the “Dominant Driver” column in the Table 3 ).\n3) Not all factors can be “clearly attributed”\nNo clear anthropogenic trend signals were found for meteorological drought (low annual precipitation or the driest month of the fire season) (observations are consistent with all 10 models). However, the combination of a positive excursion of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and a very strong negative anomaly of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in 2019 did contribute to drier weather from July to December, a significant factor contributing to the “worse” weather that year (an interannual modulation, not a long-term trend).\n\n\nBack to the original question\n\nThe answer is yes: “Extreme fire weather” like that of 2019/20 is significantly more common in the contemporary era, with extreme heat being the primary driver; observational evidence also shows a notable increase in persistence (Table 3).\n\nDrought attribution is not significant, but the IOD and SAM amplified the severity of the season in 2019.\n\nLooking into the future: Projections based on climate models show that under a global warming of 2°C, the likelihood of extreme fire events similar to those in 2019/20 is at least 4–8 times higher than in 1900 (  it should be noted that climate models underestimate the observed extreme temperature trends, so the attributable increase in fire risk may be much higher). This means that extreme forest fires may become more common in the future.\n\n\nIn general: “Hot, dry, and windy” days are becoming less unusual, especially as the “hot” factor continues to raise the “fire risk floor.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nDowdy, Andrew J., Graham A.
